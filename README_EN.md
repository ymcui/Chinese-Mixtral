This project is developed based on the [Mixtral model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) released by Mistral.ai, which utilizes a Sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. This project involves the use of large-scale Chinese unannotated data for incremental training in Chinese, resulting in the **Chinese Mixtral** base model. Further fine-tuning with instructions led to the creation of the **Chinese Mixtral-Instruct** instruction model. This model natively supports a **32K context (tested up to 128K)** and is capable of effectively processing long texts, while also showing significant performance improvements in areas like mathematical reasoning and code generation. When using llama.cpp for quantized inference, a minimum of only 16GB of memory (or VRAM) is required.

## Model Introduction

This project open-sources the Chinese Mixtral and Chinese Mixtral-Instruct models developed based on the [Mixtral model](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1), with the following main features:

#### 📖 Sparse Mixture of Experts Model

Mixtral is a Sparse Mixture of Experts model. This model significantly differs from mainstream large models like LLaMA in several aspects:

- Each FFN layer contains 8 different "experts" (fully connected layers), with the best 2 activated based on gating values.
- Every token in the input sequence independently selects an expert, rather than the entire sequence corresponding to a set of experts.
- The actual parameter count is about 46.7B, with around 13B activated during inference.

Below is a structural diagram from the [Mixtral paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04088):

    <br>
</p>

#### 🚄 Natively Supports 32K Context (Tested up to 128K)

Unlike the [Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) and [Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2) projects, the Mixtral model natively supports a 32K context (tested up to 128K). Users can use a single model to solve various tasks of different lengths.

### Download Links

Three different types of models are provided below:

- **Full Version Model**: Can be used directly without any merging steps, recommended for users with sufficient network bandwidth.
- **LoRA Version Model**: Cannot be used alone, must be merged with the original [Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-v0.1) to convert into a full version model. Recommended for users with limited network bandwidth who already have the original Mixtral. For merging method, please refer to: [**💻 Model Merging Steps**](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-Mixtral/wiki/model_conversion_en)
- **GGUF Version Model**: A GGUF quantized version model compatible with tools like [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), recommended for users who only need to perform inference deployment.

## Model Performance

To evaluate the effectiveness of the related models, this project conducted both generative effect evaluation and objective effect evaluation (NLU category), assessing large models from different perspectives. Users are recommended to test on the tasks they are interested in and choose models that are best suited for those tasks.

### Generative Effect Evaluation

- This project, inspired by [Fastchat Chatbot Arena](https://chat.lmsys.org/?arena), has launched an online model battle platform to browse and evaluate the quality of model responses. The battle platform provides evaluation metrics such as win rate and Elo rating, and one can view the win rates of model matchups. **⚔️ Model Arena: [http://llm-arena.ymcui.com](http://llm-arena.ymcui.com/)**
- The examples directory provides output samples of Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct and Chinese-Alpaca-2-13B, and compares scores using GPT-4, **with Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct averaging a score of 8.20 and Chinese-Alpaca-2-13B averaging 7.05**. **📄 Output Sample Comparison: [examples](./examples)**


### Objective Effect Evaluation

#### C-Eval

[C-Eval](https://cevalbenchmark.com) is a comprehensive Chinese baseline model evaluation suite, where the validation and test sets contain 1.3K and 12.3K multiple-choice questions, respectively, covering 52 subjects. For C-Eval inference code, please refer to this project: [📖GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-Mixtral/wiki/ceval_en)

### Quantization Effect Evaluation

Under llama.cpp, the performance of the quantized version of the Chinese-Mixtral model was tested, as shown in the table below.

|              |  F16 |   Q8_0 |   Q6_K |   Q5_K |   Q5_0 |   Q4_K |   Q4_0 |   Q3_K | IQ3_XXS |   Q2_K | IQ2_XS | IQ2_XXS |
| ------------ | ---: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | ------: | -----: | -----: | ------: |
| Size (GB)    | 87.0 |   46.2 |   35.7 |   30.0 |   30.0 |   24.6 |   24.6 |   19.0 |    17.1 |   16.1 |   12.7 |    11.4 |
| BPW          | 16.0 |   8.50 |   6.57 |   5.69 |   5.52 |   4.87 |   4.53 |   3.86 |    3.14 |   2.96 |   2.34 |    2.10 |
| PPL          |    - | 4.4076 | 4.4092 | 4.4192 | 4.4224 | 4.4488 | 4.4917 | 4.5545 |  4.5990 | 5.1846 | 6.9784 |  8.5981 |
| M3 Max Speed |    - |      - |   36.0 |   36.9 |   35.7 |   31.2 |   27.8 |   37.6 |       - |   29.1 |      - |       - |
| A100 Speed   |    - |      - |   29.9 |   22.6 |   20.5 |   21.7 |   17.1 |   21.7 |    20.6 |   20.3 |   23.7 |    22.5 |

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Model Size: in GB
> - BPW (Bits-Per-Weight): Bits per unit parameter, e.g., Q6_K has an actual average precision of 6.57 bits
> - PPL (Perplexity): Measured with a 4K context, lower values are better
> - Generation Speed: Provided for Apple M3 Max (Metal) and NVIDIA A100 (40G) generation speed (ms/token), lower values are better

Taking Chinese-Mixtral-Q4_0 as an example, the following figure shows the trend of PPL changes under different context lengths, with two different sets of pure text data selected. The experimental results indicate that **the context length supported by the Mixtral model exceeds the nominal 32K, and it still performs well in contexts of 64K+ (tested up to 128K).**

## Training and Fine-Tuning

### Pre-training

- Based on the original Mixtral model, incremental training was carried out using large-scale unlabeled data to obtain the Chinese-Mixtral base model.
- Training data used the same data as in the [Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca) project for the base model, totaling about 20G of pure text files.
- Training code and tutorial: [📖 Pre-training Scripts Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-Mixtral/wiki/pt_scripts_en)

### Instruction Fine-Tuning

- Based on Chinese-Mixtral, further fine-tuning was done using annotated instruction data to obtain the Chinese-Mixtral-Instruct instruction model.
- Training data used instruction data from the [Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-LLaMA-Alpaca-2) project, totaling about 5 million instruction data.
- Training code and tutorial: [📖 Instruction Fine-Tuning Scripts Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-Mixtral/wiki/sft_scripts_en)

[Instruction Template](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1#instruction-format):

```
<s> [INST] Instruction [/INST] Model answer</s> [INST] Follow-up instruction [/INST]
```

Note: `<s>` and `</s>` are special tokens indicating the start and end of a sequence, while `[INST]` and `[/INST]` are ordinary strings.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Please make sure to check the FAQ for existing solutions before raising an Issue. For specific questions and answers, refer to the project's [📖GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-Mixtral/wiki/faq_en)

```
Question 1: Will there be training with more data in the future? Will there be RLHF/DPO alignment?
Question 2: Why wasn't there an expansion of the Chinese vocabulary in this model?
Question 3: Is the downstream ecosystem of Mixtral supported?
